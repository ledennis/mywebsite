<hr /><h3><a name="pos"></a>Position</h3>
    <p>
        So more information into creating layouts for websites is positioning.
        Positiong refers to the location of "boxes" or divs that you create and
        wether those things will get in the way of each other or not. As of now,
        I have been working with absolute positiong. Absolute positioning makes
        it so that no matter what object is in a certain pixel, the object will
        be there even if it will conflict with another object's position. So
        the two objects will mix.
    </p>
    <div id="mesh1"> Hello? </div>
    <div id="mesh2"> There? </div>
    <br />
    <p>
        As you can see, since these two divs have absolute positioning on, the 
        area that they are taking is being conflicted.
    </p>
    <p>
        This part of the video became confusing so I went to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp">w3schools.com</a> to 
        find more information about positioning. There are three more positions
        along with absolute positioning. There is static, the default property
        for HTML elements, relative positioning, which adjusts itself depening 
        on elements around it, and fixed positioning, which is relative to the
        viewer, meaning that the element will always stay at the same place even 
        if the page is scrolled.
    </p>
<hr /><h3><a name="img"></a>Image Properties</h3>
    <p>
        The image tags have certain properties that can make it look nicer when 
        creating a website too. The have max and min properties that can resize
        any image based on it's original size.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any tag has a bunch of elements and I feel like sky is the limit if 
        there is a certain attribute that is wanted.
    </p>
<hr /><h3><a name="form"></a>Form Tag</h3>
    <p>
        There is a form tag that essentially allows a web user submit text 
        input. <br />
        &ltform&gt<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Username:</em> &ltinput type="text" name="username"
        &gt<br />
        &lt/form&gt <br />
        Would look like this: <br />
        <form>
            Username: <input type="text" name="username">
        </form><br />
        The type attribute is what the user will be submitting and the name is
        a type of id to differentiate what the user will enter.<br />
        The different type of input types so far is:<br >
        <ul>
            <li>text: user inputs a text</li>
            <li>radio: a circle is given and only one circle can be selected if
                there are more than one radio types</li>
            <li>checkbox: a box that can be checked</li>
            <li>password: hides the text with asteriks</li>
            <li>file: allows user to upload a file from computer</li>
            <li>submit: saves user input, need to learn js or PHP for this</li>
        </ul><br />
        The names and types can also be used later for web programming, which is
        part of javascript and PHP.
    </p>
<hr /><h3><a name="drop"></a>Dropdown Lists</h3>
    <p>
        To give a dropdown option to select something, the tag used is called
        the select tag. &ltselect name="<em>nameOfDropdown</em>"&gt&lt/select&gt
        and to give options, inside of the select tag use the option tag, 
        &ltoption value="
        <em>nameOfOption</em>"&gt<em>textOfOption</em>&lt/option&gt.<br />
        <form>
            <select name="example">
                <option value="1">This</option>
                <option value="2">is</option>
                <option value="3">an</option>
                <option value="4">example.</option>
            </select>
        </form>
    </p>
<hr /><h3><a name="textA"></a>Text Areas</h3>
    <p>
        Text areas are essentially what user would type in if they wanted to 
        a comment or even type up an essay and then submit that into your 
        website. It is also inside the form tag and has a relatively 
        straightforwad tag, &lttext area&gt&lt/textarea&gt. The size of the box
        can be adjusted by changing the row and column attributes.<br />
        <form>
            <textarea rows="5" cols="100">Type anything you want!</textarea>
        </form>
    </p>
<hr /><h3><a name="fin"></a>Finished!</h3>
    <p>
        Ok so I finished the long five hour video that I recently just learned 
        was created in 2011 which is five years from today. My opinion about the
        video itself is that it was mostly helpful but felt either very dumbed 
        down or really slow. Either way I feel like I know the basics of 
        designing a website and now I must learn javascript ... after I design a
        website to put the tutorial in first obviously.
