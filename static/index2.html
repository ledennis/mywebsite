<hr /><h3><a name="tables"></a>Creating a Table</h3>
    <p>
        To create an organized table, there is a table tag, &lttable&gt&lt/table
        &gt. Within the tags, rows and columns can be created using &lttr&gt&lt/
        tr&gt for rows and &lttd&gt&lt/td&gt for columns. The column tag can be 
        place in a row tag to create columns. It would look like this.
        <br /> &lttable&gt
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lttr&gt
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lttd&gt&lt/td&gt
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lttd&gt&lt/td&gt
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt/tr&gt
        <br /> &lttable&gt
        <br />This is a table with one row and two column.
        <br /><br /> The table tag also has a boreder attribute that can be set 
        with a certain pixel thickness. eg. &lttable border="<em>pixel thickness
        </em>"&gt&lt/table&gt. Headers can be added to tables to help label the 
        rows as well. The tag for table headers is &ltth&gt&lt/th&gt. Headers 
        are basically centered and bolded font and are placed within the table 
        row tag.
        <br /> Here is an example of a table with two rows and three columns per
         row with a border thickness of 2.
        <table border="2">
            <tr>
                <th>One</th>
                <th>Two</th>
                <th>Three</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="col">1</td>
                <td class="col">2</td>
                <td class="col">3</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br />Tables can also be seperated more intrically by using an attribute
         called colspan, which specifies how much columns a header/row will have.
        <table border="2">
            <tr>
                <th colspan="1">One</th>
                <th colspan="2">Two</th>
                <th colspan="3">Three</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="col">1</td>
                <td class="col">2</td>
                <td class="col">2</td>
                <td class="col">3</td>
                <td class="col">3</td>
                <td class="col">3</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br /> Width can also be changed. A table's width will default to the 
        longest text of a box entry. The table tag has a "width" attribute to 
        adjust the width, &lttable width="<em>pixel number or percentage</em>"
        &gt. If a percentage is used, the width will adjust to the size of the 
        website.
        <br /> To make a table more spacious, adjust the table's cellpadding 
        attribute. There is also a cellspacing attribute that gives more space 
        between each cell, which makes the border seem thicker.
    </p>

<hr /><h3><a name="lists"></a>Creating a List</h3>
    <p>
        A bulleted list tag is &ltul&gt&lt/ul&gt, which stands for unordered 
        list. To insert items into the list, use the list item tag, 
        &ltli&gt&lt/li&gt. 
        <br /> Here is a bulleted list.
        <ul>
            <li>Oranges</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Balloons</li>
        </ul>

        <br /> An ordered list tag is &ltol&gt&lt/ol&gt. 
        <br /> Here is an ordered list.
        <ol>
            <li>Oranges</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Balloons</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

<hr /><h3><a name="diff"></a>Difference between HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>
        This may be long overdue but HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language 
        and is essentially the core building blocks for website. Everything up 
        until now has been coded in HTML. I am now an hour and thirty-five 
        minutes into the video and he is describing CSS, which stands for 
        Cascading Style Sheet, and it is described as what makes the website 
        pretty. CSS is the layout, color, scheme, and anything else that styles 
        the website.
    </p>

<hr /><h3><a name="css"></a>Using CSS</h3>
    <p>
        When writing code for CCS, you're essentially making a document filled 
        with desgins and schemes. The CSS tag is &ltstyle&gt&lt/style&gt and it 
        must be in within the header tag with the type attribute set as 
        text/css.
        <br /> 
        &lthead&gt<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&ltstyle type="text/css"&gt <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt/style&gt <br />
        &lthead&gt
        <br />
        Within the style tag, properties can be changed to certain tags. For 
        example, if there is a type of font color that a developer wants to use 
        for the paragraph tag, it can be set in the CSS portion and that style 
        will be used for the page. In summary, a selector is used to select what 
        properties are meant to be changed given a certain value. The p tag is 
        the selector, color is the property, and blue is the value that the 
        property is set to.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;p {color:blue;}<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;This would make every paragraph's font color blue.<br />
        More properties can be changed by putting more attributes after the 
        semicolon. Colors can also be set to rgb values if there is a specific 
        color wanted. There are a lot of different properties that can be 
        changed through CSS so looking up a specific properties would probably 
        be the best option to find a unique style. Style can also be added to 
        any section of a body or the body itself to have it's own theme. As a 
        side note, my HTML is bad because I have been using line breaks instead 
        of adding more paragraph tags, which might make styling the website 
        easier, I will code taking this into consideration from now on. <br />

    </p>

<hr /><h3><a name="bgImg"></a>Using Image as a Background</h3>
    <p>
        To change the background of your website, in the style sheet, add this 
        selector. <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;body{ <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image:url(<em>nameOfImg or 
        ImgAddress</em>);<br />
        } <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        If the image is smaller than the background size, the image will tile 
        itself. To turn this off, add the property "background-repeat:no;". The 
        images can also be repeated along the x-axis by setting 
        background-repeat:repeat-x or repeated along the y-axis using 
        background-repeat:repeat-y. The position of an image can also be set by 
        using background-position: <em>(distance from the left)</em> <em>
        (distance from the top)</em>. 
    </p>

<hr /><h3><a name="text"></a>Information About Text</h3>
    <p style="background-color:red; color:white; width: 875px;">
        There are a lot of miscellaneous information to do with the text. 
        When designing how text should look, these are the things to consider.
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Size - Size of text</li>
            <li>Font - Style of text</li>
            <li>Cell Padding - How much white space is around text</li>
            <li>Borders - Outline of area of text</li>
            <li>Margin - Distance between other boxes of texts</li>
            <li>Color - Color of text</li>
            <li>Background - Visual behind text</li>
            <li>Width - Width area for text</li>
            <li>Height - Height for area of text</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<hr /><h3><a name="span"></a>Spans and Classes</h3>
    <p>
        A span is essentially a custom tag that can be used in the style sheet 
        so that only certain parts of text will be changed. The tag for span is 
        &ltspan&gt&lt/span&gt. This is a <span>random sentence</span> to show 
        the use of span, abra <span>kadabra</span> alakazam. Spans are helpful 
        since it allows easier customization of your website.<br />
        Classes are also customizable but is used more like a style. Classes are 
        represented by a period and the name of the class is what is after the 
        period. They are created in the style sheet and can be customized after 
        the name. <br />
        .thisClass {<em>custom class settings</em>}<br />
        They are used in any tag that has a section. So tags like headers, 
        paragraphs, and the body tags. Classes are useful if there is a certain 
        style you want to create.<br />
        <table border="1" width="200px">
            <tr class="red">
                <td height="5px"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="white">
                <td height="5px"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="blue">
                <td height="5px"></td>
            </tr>
        </table><br />
        Each row has a different class. To use classes, after the main tag, type
        class="<em>className</em>".

    </p>

<hr /><h3><a name="div"></a>Div</h3>
    <p>
        Divs are special because they are boxes that can be set anywhere on the 
        page using coordinates. Divs is the layout for most website and anything 
        can be placed inside a div. They are created in the style sheet and used 
        with the tag &ltdiv&gt&lt/div&gt. Here is an example of a custom div. 
        <br /><br />
        div {border:2px solid red;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position:absolute;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width:300px;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height:300px;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top:40px;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left:35px;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
        Divs can also be seperated like classes, so if you want to create 
        multiple divs, it is possible. To create a div, instead of using a 
        period like you would for classes, you would instead use a hashtag. 
        So under the style sheet, #<em>divName</em> {<em>custom div settings
        </em>}. This identifies the divs and to use a specific div, use the id 
        attribute. <br />
        &ltdiv id="<em>divName</em>"&gt&lt/div&gt

    </p>
<hr /><h3><a name="linksAdv"></a>Links Advanced</h3>
    <p>
        As you may recall, links are creating using the &lta&gt tag. Since this 
        is the part of the tutorial where there is more information on 
        customization, there is a technique to specialize certain links. For 
        example if you wanted to customize links that are contained in headers 
        and only those links, than within the style sheet, h1 > a {<em>custom 
        link setting</em>}, would only change the links that have to deal with 
        the h1 header. It is a parent child relation ship and only affects the 
        children of that parent. <br />
        Also links come in three parts, the stage before it is clicked, the 
        stage while it is clicked, and the stage after it is clicked, and all of 
        these settings can be changed as well.<br />
    </p>
<hr /><h3><a name="pseudo"></a>Pseudo Elements</h3>
    <p>
        There are certain attributes that can be used in the style sheet called 
        pseudo elements. There elements are basically pre set style's that can 
        affect certain bodies of text. For example there is a first-letter 
        pseudo element that can change the style of the first letter of all 
        paragraphs. <br />
        p:first-letter {<em>style</em>} <br />
        A random insertion of the definition of pseudo from 
        <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pseudo">dictionary.com</a> 
        because why not. pseudo - almost, approaching, or trying to be.
    </p>
<hr /><h3><a name="sheet"></a>Creating a File for Style</h3>
    <p>
        So up until now, I have been setting up the style sheet in the header of 
        the HTML file. There is another way to use a style sheet rather than 
        putting it in the header, which is by creating a CSS file. Using one CSS 
        ile is more beneficial because it would be much easier to edit a style 
        sheet through one file than through twenty different headers. To use a 
        CSS file, the file must end in <strong>.css</strong>. To incorporate it 
        into the HTML file, use a link file in the head tag, 
        &ltlink rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="<em>name of CSS 
        file</em>"&gt.
    </p>
    <p>As a side note, if there are two styles for anything, the last one that 
    was coded in will be used and the the ones before it.</p>
